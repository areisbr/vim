# .vimrc
This is my favorite VIM configuration

1. Install Vundle as described [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
2. Copy whatever you want from my .vimrc
3. Remember you must call :PluginInstall! (notice the bang) if you have added any plugins
4. Restart vim or type `:source ~/.vimrc`
